## Implementation approach
We will use Python's open-source libraries to implement this system. For speech recognition, we will use the "SpeechRecognition" library. For audio file handling, we will use "pydub". To create a vocal model, we will use "pyAudioAnalysis" for feature extraction and "scikit-learn" for model training. For text-to-speech, we will use "gTTS" (Google Text-to-Speech). The system will be command-line based, so we will use Python's built-in "argparse" library to handle command-line arguments.

## Python package name
```python
"voice_modeling_tts"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "trainer.py",
    "tts.py",
    "model.py",
    "audio_handler.py",
    "text_handler.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Trainer{
        +str audio_file
        +AudioHandler audio_handler
        +Model model
        +create_model()
        +save_model()
    }
    class TTS{
        +str text_file
        +TextHandler text_handler
        +Model model
        +load_model()
        +perform_tts()
    }
    class Model{
        +dict features
        +train_model()
    }
    class AudioHandler{
        +str audio_file
        +extract_features()
    }
    class TextHandler{
        +str text_file
        +convert_to_speech()
    }
    Trainer "1" -- "1" AudioHandler: uses
    Trainer "1" -- "1" Model: uses
    TTS "1" -- "1" TextHandler: uses
    TTS "1" -- "1" Model: uses
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Trainer
    participant A as AudioHandler
    participant M as Model
    participant TS as TTS
    participant TH as TextHandler
    T->>A: extract_features()
    A-->>T: features
    T->>M: train_model(features)
    M-->>T: model
    T->>T: save_model()
    TS->>TH: convert_to_speech()
    TH-->>TS: speech
    TS->>M: load_model()
    M-->>TS: model
    TS->>TS: perform_tts(speech, model)
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
