## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("trainer.py", "Contains the Trainer class which is responsible for training the voice model."),
    ("tts.py", "Contains the TTS class which is responsible for performing text-to-speech."),
    ("model.py", "Contains the Model class which is used by both Trainer and TTS."),
    ("audio_handler.py", "Contains the AudioHandler class which is used by Trainer for handling audio files."),
    ("text_handler.py", "Contains the TextHandler class which is used by TTS for handling text files.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "audio_handler.py",
    "text_handler.py",
    "model.py",
    "trainer.py",
    "tts.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'audio_handler.py' and 'text_handler.py' files contain utility functions for handling audio and text files respectively. These are used by the 'trainer.py' and 'tts.py' files.

The 'model.py' file contains the Model class which is used for training the voice model and performing text-to-speech. It is a shared resource between 'trainer.py' and 'tts.py'.

The 'trainer.py' file uses the AudioHandler class from 'audio_handler.py' and the Model class from 'model.py' to train the voice model.

The 'tts.py' file uses the TextHandler class from 'text_handler.py' and the Model class from 'model.py' to perform text-to-speech.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, we need to ensure that the team is familiar with the third-party Python libraries we are using. We also need to ensure that the audio and text files we are using for training and text-to-speech are in the correct format and quality.
